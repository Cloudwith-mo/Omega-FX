> [!IMPORTANT]
> **VERIFIED UPDATE (Nov 2025)**: These stats are based on the new **4-pair portfolio** (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold). The previous single-pair baselines have been deprecated.

## Evaluation Baselines (Portfolio Mode, Verified)
_42-run Monte Carlo simulation with step=100 on 60-day dataset._

| Firm        | Pass Rate | Mean Return | Max Daily Loss | Max Trailing DD | Mean Trades/Run | **Verdict** |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **FundedNext** | **71.4%** | **9.5%**    | **1.23%**      | **2.43%**       | 90.7            | **IDEAL** (8% target is easy) |
| **FTMO**       | **71.4%** | **9.5%**    | **1.23%**      | **2.43%**       | 90.7            | **GOOD** (10% target is achievable) |
| **Aqua Instant** | **71.4%** | **9.5%**  | **1.23%**      | **2.43%**       | 90.7            | **GOOD** (Fast execution helps) |

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Insight**: The portfolio performs identically across all firms because the strategy is risk-capped internally. The only difference is the profit target (FundedNext = 8%, FTMO = 10%). With a 9.5% mean return, **FundedNext is the easiest** to pass.
