# HFT Safety Rails Configuration
# Conservative defaults to prevent high-frequency trading behavior

safety_rails:
  # Maximum trades per symbol per hour (prevents machine-gun trading)
  max_trades_per_symbol_per_hour: 2
  
  # Maximum trades per strategy per day (prevents runaway strategies)
  max_trades_per_strategy_per_day: 10
  
  # Minimum seconds between trades on same symbol (cooldown)
  # 900 seconds = 15 minutes
  min_seconds_between_trades_per_symbol: 900
  
  # Sanity thresholds for stop distances (in pips)
  # These are minimums - trades with smaller stops will be flagged
  min_sl_pips:
    EURUSD: 10
    GBPUSD: 10
    USDJPY: 10
    XAUUSD: 50  # Gold is more volatile, needs wider stops
    GCF: 50     # Gold futures
    default: 10  # For any unlisted symbols
    
  # Sanity thresholds for hold times (seconds)
  # Trades closing faster than this will be flagged as potential scalping
  min_hold_seconds: 600  # 10 minutes minimum

# Reporting thresholds for sanity checker
reporting:
  # Alert if median hold time is below this (seconds)
  alert_median_hold_below: 3600  # 1 hour
  
  # Alert if any SL distance is below min + this margin
